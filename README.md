Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Consumption

The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and non-administrative company that is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company has suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.

A crucial problem that these companies face is the imbalance between the energy billed and the energy delivered. This problem is called energy losses caused by fraud or technical causes like meter malfunctions, pipes damages and other technical issues.
